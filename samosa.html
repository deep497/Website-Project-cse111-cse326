            <div class="b"><h3>Samosa is a popular triangular pastry filled with a savory mixture, typically composed of spiced potatoes, peas, and sometimes minced meat. The outer layer is made from a thin, crispy dough, creating a delightful contrast with the flavorful and aromatic interior. Deep-fried to golden perfection, samosas are enjoyed as a delicious and portable snack in many South Asian cuisines. They are often served with chutney for an extra burst of taste.
