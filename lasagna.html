    <h1>LASAGNA</h1><hr>
    <h3>Lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.

        Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural. The name is believed to come from a Latin word for cooking pot, lasanum, though some etymologies trace it to the Greek flatbread called laganon, known in Italy.</h3>
    <h2><u>INGREDIENTS</u></h2><br>
<p><b>2 teaspoons extra olive oil<br>
1 pound ground beef chuck<br>
1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)<br>
1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato <br>>
3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)<br>
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano<br>
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed<br>
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning<br>
1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt<br>
1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar<br>
1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)<br></p>
<h2><u>RECIPE</u></h2><p>Preheat the oven to 350°F.<br> In a large pot of salted water, boil lasagna noodles until al dente according to package directions. <br>Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.<br>
In a large skillet or dutch oven, brown beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.<br>
Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. <br>Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until thickened.<br>
In a separate bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.<br>
Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a  pan or casserole dish.<br> Top it with 3 lasagna noodles.<br> Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. <br>Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.<br>
Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. <br>
Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese.<br> Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.<br>
Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.<br></p></b>
