    <h1> Receipe for Doner Kebab a turkish delight.</h1><br><hr>
    <h2>Döner kebab is a popular Turkish street food that has become widely popular worldwide. It consists of seasoned and marinated meat, usually lamb, chicken, or a combination of both, stacked in a vertical rotisserie. The meat is slowly cooked as it rotates, allowing for even cooking and a delicious, crispy exterior.

        The cooked meat is typically shaved off in thin slices and served in various ways. It can be enjoyed in a flatbread such as pita or lavash, along with fresh vegetables, salad, and a variety of sauces. Common toppings include lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and sometimes yogurt-based sauces like tzatziki.
        
        Döner kebab is known for its flavorful and tender meat, often seasoned with a blend of spices like cumin, coriander, paprika, and garlic. The dish is a convenient and delicious option for a quick meal, and its popularity extends well beyond Turkey, with variations and adaptations found in many countries around the world.

        STEP 1
Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with a large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together. 
<br>
STEP 2
Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick layer of stuffed vegetable, roughly the shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker shape.
<br>
STEP 3
Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, then unwrap the foil. Place back on the tray and brown under the grill or with a blowtorch.
<br>
STEP 4
Place on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a roasting fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments, including our chilli sauce and garlic yogurt sauce.
