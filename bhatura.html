    <h1>Chole Bhatura</h1><hr>
    <div id="image">   <div><h2>Chole Bhatura is a popular North Indian dish that consists of two main components: chole (spiced chickpeas) and bhatura (fried bread). The dish is a delightful combination of spicy and tangy chickpeas served with soft and fluffy deep-fried bread.

        The chole are prepared by cooking chickpeas in a flavorful blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and others. The addition of tomatoes, onions, and various aromatic herbs enhances the taste. The dish often includes amchoor (dried mango powder) or tamarind pulp to impart a tangy flavor.
        
        Bhatura, the accompanying bread, is made from a dough of all-purpose flour, yogurt, and a leavening agent. The dough is allowed to ferment, and then small balls are rolled out into flat rounds and deep-fried until they puff up and turn golden brown.
        
        Chole Bhatura is commonly served with accompaniments like pickles, yogurt, or sliced onions. It is a popular street food and is also enjoyed at home during special occasions or as a festive treat. The contrast of the flavorful chickpeas and the airy, fried bread makes Chole Bhatura a beloved dish in Indian cuisine.
